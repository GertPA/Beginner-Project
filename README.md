# Beginner-Project
 So, this repository is basically where I'm dumping all the projects I'm doing as a beginner C# coder. Yeah, I know the code might be horrendous, but hey, we all gotta start somewhere, right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

The projects I've got in here so far include :
1.  Yes-and-no quiz
2.  Number guessing game from 1 to 100
3. The Dominion of Kings
4.Console Baseball Ticket Machine
